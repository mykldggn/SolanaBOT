This is a Solana local trading bot that is structured to do the following:
  1. Notifies the user when the chosen wallet has submitted a trade on the chosen platform (Pump.fun, Raydium, Moonshot(lol), etc).
  2. Gives the user an option to link to their Photon wallet to copy the trade.
  3. Provides summary statistics when a wallet is first chosen, such as:
     a. (PNL [30day, All time, etc]
     b. Avg length of time (days, hours) of possession for sold coins
     c. Holding rate (% of bought coins currently still holding in past [x] amount of time
  
This is currently fairly basic and I am looking to expand on this thoroughly in the coming weeks.
